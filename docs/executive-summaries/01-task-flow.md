# Task Flow - Executive Summary

## How Work Moves in 10x PM

```
BACKLOG --> TODO --> DOING --> REVIEW --> DONE --> ARCHIVED
 (Ideas)  (Planned) (Working) (Checking) (Complete) (History)
```

## 6 Systems Working on Every Task

```
WORKFLOW    -> Controls stage movement
PERMISSIONS -> Checks who can do what
NOTIFICATIONS -> Alerts right people
AI INTELLIGENCE -> Learns & suggests
REVIEW SYSTEM -> Verifies quality
AUTOMATION -> Triggers actions
```

## Real Example

```
1. CEO creates project -> AI: "Similar to past project (6 weeks)"
2. PM creates task     -> AI: "Suggest P2, estimated 3 days"
3. Lead plans sprint   -> AI: "Sprint at 85% capacity"
4. Sarah starts work   -> Automation: Start timer
5. Sarah submits       -> Reviewer Mike notified
6. Mike approves       -> AI: "Completed in 2.5 days (estimated 3)"
```

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Task Stages | 6 |
| Priority Levels | 4 (P1-P4) |
| Systems per Task | 6 simultaneous |
| Review Decisions | 3 (Approve/Reject/Escalate) |
